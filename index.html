 <h1>Hi, my name is Daniel Hochstetler.<br>Thanks for stopping by.</h1><br>

 <h1>After 15 years of screen printing...<br>The time to switch from web spray to web development has come.</h1>

 <p>I started screen printing on August 3rd, 2003 and have been in the industry non stop since that day, 
  minus a few weeks of moving across the country...3 times. As of today I have not been in a print shop 
  since November 12th, 2018.Â What have I been doing? Learning web development all day every day. 
  During the last 6 years of being in the screen printing industry I had gone from Printer to 
  Graphic Designer and then on to Production Manager. I started working in photoshop in 2008, 
  but did not design daily until 2013 when I had the wonderful opportunity to get to learn Adobe 
  Illustrator on the job while creating apparel for screen printing. I fell in love with Illustrator 
  and have used it almost every single day since learning it.</p>

<p>My screen printing knowledge and experience has given me the ability to move around the country 
and instantly have a job as soon as I got to a new location. I learned so much over the years and 
have progressed as an artist and a designer. It has been amazing, but I'm done.</p>

<p>Over the last 8 years I met the love of my life while living in Portland, Oregon, got married, became a father and then 
moved across the country from Portland to Holmes County, Ohio. I lived in a tipi and then in a cabin in the largest 
amish community on the planet. After that I moved back across the country to downtown Portland again working for an awesome 
apparel company. Recently I took the bold step to buy a home 2 hours outside of Portland in the beautiful Columbia River Gorge 
in the middle of nowhere, and have started working remotely from my home office as a designer while learning developing 
everyday all day.</p>

<p>I have realized that I absolutely love developing and am ready to commit to this field for the next 25 years. 
It's like nothing else I've ever done, but it has aspects of everything I love. I get to build things from scratch, 
as I have always loved taking ideas, mocking them up, turning them into prototypes and then creating a final product 
from start to finish. I love learning and with developing I get to learn new things every day on my path towards 
developing for a living. Life is good.</p>
