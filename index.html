 <h1>After 15 years of screen printing...<br>The time to switch from web spray to web development has come.</h1>

 <div class="b">
<p>I started screen printing on August 3rd, 2003 and have been in the industry non stop since that day, 
  minus a few weeks of moving across the country...3 times. As of today I have not been in a print shop 
  since November 12th, 2018.Â What have I been doing? Learning web development all day every day. 
  During the last 6 years of being in the screen printing industry I had gone from Printer to 
  Graphic Designer and then on to Production Manager. I started working in photoshop in 2008, 
  but did not design daily until 2013 when I had the wonderful opportunity to get to learn Adobe 
  Illustrator on the job while creating apparel for screen printing. I fell in love with Illustrator 
  and have used it almost every single day since learning it.</p>
</div>

<div class="b">
<p>My screen printing knowledge and experience has given me the ability to move around the country 
and instantly have a job as soon as I got to a new location. I learned so much over the years and 
have progressed as an artist and a designer. It has been amazing, but I'm done.</p>
<div>

<div class="b">
<p>Over the last 8 years I met the love of my life while living in Portland, Oregon, got married, became a father and then 
moved across the country from Portland to Holmes County, Ohio. I lived in a tipi and then in a cabin in the largest 
amish community on the planet. After that I moved back across the country to downtown Portland again working for an awesome 
apparel company. Recently I took the bold step to buy a home 2 hours outside of Portland in the beautiful Columbia River Gorge 
in the middle of nowhere, and have started working remotely from my home office as a designer while learning developing 
everyday all day.</p>
</div>

<div class="b">
<p>I have realized that I absolutely love developing and am ready to commit to this field for the next 25 years. 
It's like nothing else I've ever done, but it has aspects of everything I love. I get to build things from scratch, 
as I have always loved taking ideas, mocking them up, turning them into prototypes and then creating a final product 
from start to finish. I love learning and with developing I get to learn new things every day on my path towards 
developing for a living. Life is good.</p>

<h2>Remote Software Developer</h2>

 <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>The moment I created my first "Hello World" I was hooked.<br><br>My love of solving logical problems, building useful things
and experimenting with new technologies, coupled with my appetite for continually learning, improving and growing have
fueled my passion for developing.
  Software Development has given me engaging challenges that continuously improve my skills and allow me to learn 
  new technologies on a daily basis. I love it. It has become my full-blown passion and has never been just a job for me. 
  Below you'll find projects I've completed that showcase my skills and general background in developing software.
 
<h2>Experience</h2>
I am currently a remote designer for the apparel company GreenLayer, located in Portland, Oregon.
I work from my remote home office 2 hours outside of Portland, in the small town of Wasco, Oregon.
